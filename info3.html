<H1>  DXC TECHNOLOGY  </H1>

<P> DXC Technology was founded in 2017 as the result of the spin-off of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Enterprise Service segment and its merger with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC).[citation needed] At the time of its creation, DXC Technology had revenues of $25 billion, employed 170,000 people and operated in 70 countries.[3]

The spinoff from HPE did not include two parts of the Enterprise Service segment: the Mphasis Limited reporting unit and the Communications and Media Solutions product group.[citation needed]

In India, the company started a three-year plan to reduce the number of offices in the country from 50 to 26, and reduce headcount by 5.9% (around 10,000) employees.[4] With about 43,000 employees (more than 1/3rd of its workforce) in India, the company is restructuring its workforce to meet its new revenue profile.[5]

In 2017, DXC split off its public sector segment to create a new company, Perspecta Inc.[6]
